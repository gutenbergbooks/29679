<h3>SOME NOTES AT STARMOUTH.</h3>

<p>3 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>&mdash;Arrive at Starmouth&mdash;the retired Watering-place at
which I propose to write the Nautical Drama that is to render me
famous and wealthy. Leave luggage at Station, and go in search of
lodgings. Hotel out of the question&mdash;<i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> quite fatal to
inspiration. On the Esplanade, noting likely places with critical
eye. Perhaps I <i>am</i> a little fastidious. What I should <i>really</i> like
is a little cottage; two bow-windows, clematis on porch, flagstaff, and
cannon (if it wouldn't go off) in front. I could achieve immortality
in a place like that. Sea-view, of course, <i>indispensable</i>. Must be
within sight of the ever-changing ocean, within hearing of "the
innumerable laughter of the waves"&mdash;I know what the phrase
<i>means</i>, though I shouldn't like to have to explain it, and the waves
just now are absolutely roaring.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/097-800.png"><img src="images/097-600.png" width="600" height="453" alt="Down by the Sea." /></a>
<h4>Down by the Sea.</h4></div>

<p>3&middot;15.&mdash;Still noting; plenty of time, and Starmouth "all before me
where to choose." More than a mile of Esplanade, and several brass
plates and cards advertising "Apartments." Must be cautious&mdash;not
throw the handkerchief in a hurry. Haven't seen the ideal
place <i>yet</i>.</p>

<p>3&middot;30.&mdash;Better make a beginning. Try "Blenheim House" (all the
houses here either bear ducal, naval, or frankly plebeian names, I
observe). Ring: startling effect&mdash;grey-mouldy old person, with
skeleton hands folded on woollen tippet, glides in a ghastly manner
down passage. They really ought to put up a warning to people
with nerves, as M. <span class="sc">Van Beers</span> does at his <i>Salon Parisien</i>. Feel as
if I had raised a ghost. Wonder if she waits on lodgers&mdash;if so, my
dinners will be rather like the banquet <span class="sc">Gulliver</span> had at Laputa.
"Has she rooms to let at once?" "No?" "<i>Oh!</i>" Well out of
<i>that!</i></p>

<p>3&middot;45.&mdash;Warming to my work. Ring at door in "Amelia Terrace."
Maid appears&mdash;nice-looking girl, rather. "Have you"&mdash;I begin&mdash;when
I see a boy at the ground-floor window. Don't object to boys,
as a class, but this particular boy is pallid, with something round
his throat, and an indescribable air about him of conscious deadliness,
and pride in the unusual terror he inspires, which can only be
accounted for by recent Measles. Never under the same roof with
<i>that</i> boy! He eyes me balefully, and I stare back, fascinated.
"Have you," I begin again&mdash;(I am full of resource, thank goodness!)
"a Mrs. <span class="sc">Walker</span>&mdash;(first appropriate name that occurs to me)&mdash;staying
here?" By a horrible coincidence, they <i>have</i>! She has
taken the ground-floor&mdash;where that boy is! Awkward&mdash;very....
I manage to gasp out, "Then will you please mention that I
called?" and retire before she can ask my name. Presence of mind,
again!</p>

<p>4 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>&mdash;Still seeking. Not so fastidious as I <i>was</i>. Have given up
the cottage, and clematis, and flagstaff. Only place answering that
description belongs&mdash;or so I inferred, from his language&mdash;to a retired
sea-captain, whom I disturbed in his nap to inquire whether he let
lodgings. As it happened, he <i>didn't</i>. Then (as I very nearly went
back and told him) what right had he to sport a brass plate? However,
I got some good racy dialogue for the Nautical Drama out
of him.</p>

<p>4&middot;15.&mdash;More failures. Starmouth busy digesting, which it does
publicly in bow-windows. I must <i>not</i> be so particular. I will do
without balconies&mdash;even bow-windows&mdash;but I cannot, I will not, sit
on horsehair furniture.</p>

<p>4&middot;20.&mdash;After all, so long as I get a sea-view, what matters? I can
be nautical and dramatic on <i>any</i> kind of chair. And "Collingwood
House," too&mdash;what a name for me! I will go in. Rejected again&mdash;nothing
till Thursday fortnight! I am beginning to feel like an unpopular
man at a dance. I regard the people wallowing at the
windows with a growing hate; they are the elect&mdash;but that is no
reason why they should parade it in that ostentatious way&mdash;bad
taste!... Can't get any rooms along these terraces&mdash;I subdue
my pride, and try a back-street.</p>

<p>4&middot;30.&mdash;Nature too strong for me&mdash;I <i>must</i> face the sea. Surely
there must be <i>some</i> cards I have overlooked!... Thought so!
staring me in the face all the time! Ring&mdash;ghost effect again&mdash;same
old grey lady! She asks me, in hollow tones, what I want. I ask
her whether I left my umbrella here (full of resource!) "No!"
"Oh!" Back-street again after that.</p>

<p>4&middot;40.&mdash;Even the back-streets will have none of me! I grow
morbid. Remember words of song, entreating vague somethings
(perhaps stars) "to smile on their vagabond boy"&mdash;no one smiles on
me. And <i>I</i> to have vapoured about "throwing the handkerchief."
Fool&mdash;fool!... They are more sympathetic in the back-streets,
though. "Starmouth is very full!" They say, complacently, "they
don't know if there's any place I <i>could</i> get into, not to say at
once&mdash;they
really <i>don't</i>!"</p>

<p>5 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>&mdash;Back on the Esplanade again. Why, I certainly haven't
been <i>here</i> before. Ring. While I am waiting for some one to
appear, face rises at window&mdash;<i>the measly boy!</i> Confound these
terrace-houses, all alike! This time I <i>don't</i> wait&mdash;I bolt. They
will think I am a clown out for a holiday, but I can't help that.</p>

<p>5&middot;15.&mdash;No, I must draw the line somewhere. At "Hatfield
House," (good address this) landlady appears with eruptive face,
powdered&mdash;effect not entirely happy&mdash;but I waive that. She has
rooms&mdash;but the sitting-room is out at the end of a yard, and I am to
get to my bed room through the kitchen! Can't write an epoch-making
drama under those conditions.</p>

<p>5&middot;30.&mdash;I am growing humbler&mdash;I would almost take a coal-cellar
now. Think I will go back to Hatfield and recant.... I have.
"Very sorry&mdash;this moment let".... "Oh!"</p>

<p>5&middot;35.&mdash;<i>At last!</i> May choicest blessings light upon the head of
<span class="sc">Plapper</span>!&mdash;or rather of Mrs. <span class="sc">Plapper</span>, as her husband is out.
She
has taken me in! Charming rooms&mdash;not actually facing the sea, but
with capital view of it round corner from bow-window. <span class="sc">Plapper</span> is
an optician&mdash;wonder whether it is weak eyes, or wifely duty,
that makes Mrs. P. wear blue spectacles? Everything arranged&mdash;terms
most reasonable&mdash;now to recover luggage. Stop; better ask
address&mdash;or I might never be able to find my optician again&mdash;like
<i>Mrs. Barrett Browning</i> and her lost Bower! "You've only got to
use <span class="sc">Plapper's</span> name, Sir, anywhere, and it will be all right," says
Mrs. P. with natural pride. Very convenient. For instance: <i>Stern
Constable</i> (to me). "Can't come in here, Sir." <i>Myself.</i> "Can't I,
though? <i><span class="sc">Plapper</span>!</i>" And in I go! Or I am in a scrape of some
sort: "Have you anything to say?" asks the Inspector. I whisper
in his ear, "<span class="sc">Plapper</span>!" And they grovel and release me.</p>

<p>5&middot;45.&mdash;Odd&mdash;but now I find myself wondering ungratefully,
whether I mightn't have done better than <span class="sc">Plapper</span>, after all. This
is human nature, I suppose&mdash;but discreditable. I <i>am</i> overjoyed&mdash;really.
I no longer hate people. <i>I</i> too am an initiate! But I can
pity poor devils who are houseless, I hope.... I order sundry
things: "Send them in to <span class="sc">Plapper's</span>." Luggage regained and sent
back&mdash;to <span class="sc">Plapper's</span>. I feel self-respect once more.</p>

<p>6 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>&mdash;Returning to <span class="sc">Plapper's</span>. And in this secure retreat my
Nautical drama is destined to see the light&mdash;if <span class="sc">Plapper</span> only knew!
I feel an affection already for this humble temporary home. Mrs. P.
meets me at the door. "So sorry, Sir&mdash;but <i>you can't have the rooms,
after all</i>! <span class="sc">Plapper</span> had let 'em quite unbeknown to me!"</p>

<p>And this is Saturday! <i>I am under a curse!</i></p>

<h3>THE BALLET.</h3>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>What was it first my fancy fed,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">

</div>

<p>"The modern Venetian takes pleasure not only in neglecting but in persecuting
the palace and the gondola.... As to the gondola, the mass of Venetians
possess none, and rarely go in them.... They forget that the much-desired
foreigner does not come to Venice to read signboards from a steamboat up and
down the Grand Canal; and, by handing over this magnificent waterway to
a company of foreign speculators, they have well-nigh reduced the ancient
body of gondoliers to beggary. The steamers are numerous and noisy.... If
one contrasts the passengers of these rival craft, the gondola and the
<i>vaporetto</i>,
one asks which, as a body, most contribute to the prosperity of Venice,
and so merits most consideration.... The penny steamer and the gondola
are irreconcileable, and cannot exist long together, for the simple reason that
the gondoliers cannot earn a support, and must take to other avocations."</p>

<p><span class="sc">People</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Imprey</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">George Smith</span> (of Coalville),

actually to be found contending for the barren honour of having invented that
terrible nuisance of a catch-phrase, "Three Acres and a Cow!" Strange and
morbid perversion of ambition! As well fight for the deep discredit of having
been
the first to hit upon such kindred controversial horrors as the boring and
question-begging "gags" of "Law and Order," "Patriot first, and Party-man
afterwards," "Hand over to the tender mercies, &amp;c.," "Disintegration of the
Empire," or even that most hackneyed of political phrases, "Grand Old Man"
itself. Now, if any one took credit to himself for never, never having uttered
the "Acre and Cow" Shibboleth, or made use of any others of these soul-sickening
bits of polemical claptrap, <i>Mr. Punch could</i> understand, and admire,
and envy. There be things that <i>everybody</i>&mdash;possessed of sense and

<h3>ALL IN PLAY.</h3>

<p class="ind2"><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:200px;"><a href="images/100.png"><img src="images/100-200.png" width="200" height="301" alt="All in Play" /></a></div>

<p style="margin-top:-1em;"><span class="ind">This year has been a great one for America in London.</span> The
Exhibition in West Kensington, with its Wild West Show, has
attracted its thousands, and at this
moment two dramas (both from the
United States) are very popular in
the Strand and Oxford Street. A
few nights ago, anxious to save you
the trouble of filling a stall with your
customary urbanity and critical
acumen (to say nothing of your
august person and opera-glasses), I
visited the Princess's, to assist at a
performance of <i>The Shadows of a
Great City</i>. It was really a most
amusing piece, written by <span class="sc">Jefferson</span>,
the <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> of our youth,
who you will remember was wont in
years gone by to drink to the health
of ourselves and our wives and our
families at the Adelphi. The <i>City</i>
was New York, and the most substantial
of the <i>Shadows</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">J. H.
Barnes</span>, a gentleman who might be
aptly described as one of the
"heaviest" of our light comedians. He played a fine-hearted sailor
with an earnestness of purpose that carried all before it. I cannot
conscientiously say that he gave me the idea that he was exactly
fitted to take command of the Channel Fleet, but after seeing him I
retained the impression that he would have felt entirely at home on
the quarter-deck of a Thames Steamboat. Mr. <span class="sc">Harry Nicholls</span>,
who has so often assisted to make the fortune (as a jocular scoundrel)
of a Drury Lane melodrama, was also in the cast, and so was Miss
<span class="sc">Cicely Richards</span>, <i>the Belinda</i> of <i>Our Boys</i>. Then there was
Miss
<span class="sc">Mary Rorke</span>, a most sympathetic heroine, and several other excellent
performers, whose names, however, were less familiar to me.</p>

<p>The play, admirably mounted with capital scenery, recalled a
number of pleasant memories. Here was a suggestion of <i>The Ticket
of Leave Man</i>, there a notion from <i>The Colleen Bawn</i>, and yonder
ideas from <i>The Long Strike</i> and <i>Arrah-na-Pogue</i>. There is nothing
new under the sun, and <i>The Shadows of a Great City</i> is no exception
to the rule. However, it is a thoroughly exciting play, full of murder
and mirth, wrong-doing and waggery, startling incidents, and side-splitting
comicalities. It was certainly greatly enjoyed, when I saw
it, by the audience, who cheered Mr. <span class="sc">Barnes</span> and Miss <span class="sc">Rorke</span> to
the
echo, and hissed all their enemies to their heart's content, as a
reward for the most effectively-simulated villany.</p>

<p>Very soon all the Theatres will be busy with the Autumn-cum-Winter
Season. The first on the List is Drury Lane, which, reserving
<span class="sc">Payne</span> for the Pantomime at Christmas, opens in September with
<i>Pleasure</i>.</p>


<p class="right">Always yours sincerely,</p>

<h3>SALUBRITIES ABROAD.</h3>

<p><i>Still at Royat. Hotel Continental.&mdash;&Agrave; propos</i> of <span class="sc">Puller</span> "airing
his French" Miss <span class="sc">Louisa Metterbrun</span> said something <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'delighful'">delightful</ins> to
him the other day at dinner. <span class="sc">Puller</span> had been instructing us all in
some French idioms until Madame <span class="sc">Metterbrun</span> set him right in his
pronunciation. He owned that he had made a slip. "But," says
he, wagging his head and pulling up his wristbands with the air of
a man thoroughly well satisfied with himself generally, "but I
think you'll allow that I can speak French better than most Englishmen,
eh?"</p>

<p>Madame <span class="sc">Metterbrun</span> doesn't exactly know what to say, but Miss
<span class="sc">Louisa</span> comes to the rescue. "O Mr. <span class="sc">Puller</span>"&mdash;he is frequently
at their house in London, and they know him intimately&mdash;"I always
say to Mamma, when we're abroad, that I do like to hear you talk
French"&mdash;<span class="sc">Puller</span> smirks and thinks to himself that this is a girl of
sense and rare appreciation&mdash;"because," she goes on quietly, and all
at table are listening, "because your speaking French reminds me
so of home." Her home is London. I think <span class="sc">Puller</span> won't ask
Miss <span class="sc">Louisa</span> for an opinion on his French accent again in a hurry.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have just been reading <span class="sc">Victor Hugo's</span> <i>Choses Vues</i>. Admirable!
<i>Fuite de Louis Philippe!</i> What a pitiful story. Then his account,
marvellously told, and the whole point of the narrative given in two
lines, of what became of the brain of <span class="sc">Talleyrand</span>. Graphically written
is his visit to <span class="sc">Thiers</span> on behalf of <span class="sc">Rochefort</span>. Says
<span class="sc">Thiers</span> to him,
"<i>Cent journaux me tra&icirc;nent tous les matins dans la boue. Mais
savez-vous mon proc&eacute;d&eacute;? Je ne les lis pas.</i>" To which <span class="sc">Hugo</span>
rejoined, "<i>C'est pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment ce que je fais. Lire les diatribes, c'est
respirer les latrines de sa renomm&eacute;e.</i>" Most public men, certainly
most authors, artists, and actors, would do well to remember this
advice, and act upon it.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i>Choses Vues</i>," written "<i>Shows Vues</i>" would be a good heading
for an all-round-about theatrical and entertainment article in
<i>Mr. Punch's</i> pages. Patent this.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Puller</span> has recovered his high spirits. The temperature has
changed: the waters are agreeing with him. So is the dinner hour,
which <span class="sc">M. Hall</span>, our landlord, kindly permits us to have at the
exceptional and un-Royat-like hour of 7&middot;30. At dinner he is convivial.
Madame <span class="sc">Metterbrun</span> and her two daughters are discussing
music. Cousin <span class="sc">Jane</span> is deeply interested in listening to Madame
<span class="sc">Metterbrun</span> on <span class="sc">Wagner</span>. The young Ladies are thorough
Wagnerites. La Contessa is unable to get a word in about <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>
and <span class="sc">Salvini</span>, and her daughter, who, in a quiet tone and
with a most deliberate manner, announces herself as belonging to
the "Take-everything-easy Society," is not at this particular
moment interested in anything except the <i>menu</i>, which she is lazily
scrutinising through her long-handled <i>pince-nez</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="sc">Dinderlin</span>, having succumbed to the usual first attack of
Royat depression, is leaning back in her chair, smelling salts and
nodding assent to the Wagnerite theories, with which she entirely
agrees. For my own part, I am neutral; but as the <span class="sc">Metterbruns</span>
are thorough musicians,&mdash;the mother being a magnificent pianist, and
the eldest daughter a composer,&mdash;I am really interested in hearing all
they have to say on the subject. Our bias is, temporarily, decidedly
Wagnerian, for Cousin <span class="sc">Jane</span>, who is really in favour of "tune,"
and plenty of it,&mdash;being specially fond of <span class="sc">Bellini</span> and
<span class="sc">Donizetti</span>,&mdash;in
scientific musical society has not the courage of her opinions.</p>

<p>From composers the conversation travels to executants, and we
name the favourite singers. After we have pretty well exhausted
the list, and objected to this one as having a head voice, or to that
as using the <i>vibrato</i>, or to the other as dwelling on an upper note
("queer sort of existence," says <span class="sc">Puller</span>, gradually coming up, as
it were to the surface to open his mouth for breath,&mdash;whereat Cousin
<span class="sc">Jane</span> smiles, and Miss <span class="sc">Casanova</span> lazily nods approbation of the
joke&mdash;while the rest of us ignore <span class="sc">Puller</span>, putting him aside as not
wanted just now,&mdash;when down he goes again), we generally agree
that <span class="sc">Gayarr&eacute;</span> is about the best tenor we have had in London for some
time; that <span class="sc">Santley</span> is still unequalled as a baritone; that there is no
one now to play and sing <i>Mephistopheles</i> like <span class="sc">Faure</span>; that M.
<span class="sc">Maurel</span>
is about the finest representative of <i>Don Giovanni</i>; that Miss
<span class="sc">Arnoldson</span>
shows great promise; that <span class="sc">Albany</span> is unrivalled; that <span class="sc">Marie
Roze</span> is difficult to beat as <i>Carmen</i>; and that it is a pity that
<span class="sc">Patti's</span> demands are so exorbitant; and having exhausted the list
of operatic artists,&mdash;Madame and her daughters holding that certain
Germans, with whose names we, unfortunately for us, are not even
acquainted, are far superior to any French or Italian singers that
can be named&mdash;there ensues a pause in the conversation, of which
the Countess <span class="sc">Casanova</span> takes advantage, and extending her right
hand, which movement sharply jingles her bracelets, and so, as it
were, sounds a bell to call us to attention, cuts in quickly with an
emphatic, "Well, I don't profess to understand music as <i>you</i> do. I
know what I like"&mdash;("Hear! hear!" <i>sotto voce</i> from <span class="sc">Puller</span>,
coming up again to the surface, which draws a languidly approving
inclination of the head from Miss <span class="sc">Casanova</span>, and a smile, deprecating
the interruption, from Cousin <span class="sc">Jane</span>),&mdash;"and I must say,"
continues the Countess, emphatically, "I would rather have one hour
of <span class="sc">Salvini</span> in <i>Othello</i>, than a whole month of the best Operas by
the
best composers,&mdash;<span class="sc">Wagner</span> included," and down comes her hand on
the table, all the bracelets ringing down the curtain on the first act.</p>

<p>We, the non-combatants, feel that the mailed gauntlet has been
thrown down by the Countess as a challenge to the <span class="sc">Metterbruns</span>.</p>

<p>"O Mother!" faintly remonstrates Miss <span class="sc">Casanova</span>, who loves a
stall at the Opera. She fears that her mother's energetic declaration
means war, and fans herself helplessly.</p>

<p>I am preparing to reconcile music and the drama, and am getting
ready a supply of oil for what I foresee will be troubled waters, as
the <span class="sc">Metterbruns</span> are beginning to rustle their feathers and flap
their wings,&mdash;when <span class="sc">Puller</span>, leaning well forward, and stretching
out an explanatory hand, with his elbow planted firmly on the table,
("Very bad manners," says Cousin <span class="sc">Jane</span> afterwards to me) says
genially, "Well, <i>voyez vous</i>, look here, you may talk of your
<span class="sc">Wagners</span> and <span class="sc">Shakspeares</span>, and <span class="sc">Gayarr&eacute;s</span>, and
<span class="sc">Pattis</span>, but, for
singing and acting, give me <span class="sc">Arthur Roberts</span>. Yes," he repeats
pleasantly but defiantly, and taking up, as it were, the Countess's
gauntlet, "<span class="sc">Salvini's</span> not in it with <span class="sc">Arthur Roberts</span>."</p>

<p>The Countess's fan spreads out and works furiously. The steam is
getting up. The <span class="sc">Metterbruns</span> open their eyes, and regard one
another in consternation. They don't know who <span class="sc">Arthur Roberts</span> is.</p>

<p>"Not know!" exclaims <span class="sc">Puller</span>, quite in his element. "Well,
when you come to London, you send to me, and I'll take you to
hear him."</p>

<p>"He's a Music-Hall singer," says the Countess, fanning herself
with an air of contemptuous indifference.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>

<p>"Music-Hall Ar-<i>tiste</i>!" returns <span class="sc">Puller</span>, emphasising the second
syllable, which to his mind expresses a great deal, and makes all
the difference. "Now, Miladi," he goes on, imitating the manner
of one of his own favourite counsel, engaged by <span class="sc">Puller &amp; Co.</span>,
conducting
a cross-examination, "Have you ever seen him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replies, shrugging her shoulders, "once. And," she
adds, making the bracelets jingle again, as with a tragedy queen's
action of the right arm she sweeps away into space whole realms of
Music Halls and comic singers, "that was quite enough."</p>

<p>"Didn't he make you laugh?" continues <span class="sc">Puller</span>, still in the
character of a stern cross-examiner.</p>

<p>"Laugh!" almost shrieks the Countess, extending her hands so
suddenly that I have only time to throw myself back to avoid a
sharp tap on the head from her fan. "Heavens! not a bit! not the
least bit in the world! He made me sad! I saw the people in the
stalls laughing, and I said,"&mdash;here she appeals with both hands to
the majority of sensible people at large&mdash;still at large&mdash;"'Am I
stupid? am I dull? Do I not understand?'"</p>

<p>"O Mother!" expostulates her daughter, in her most languid
manner, "he <i>was</i> funny!"</p>

<p>"Funny!" ejaculates the Countess, tossing her head.</p>

<p>"I'd rather see <span class="sc">Arthur Roberts</span> than <span class="sc">Salvini</span>," says
<span class="sc">Puller</span>,
waggishly, but with conviction.</p>

<p>"I think I would, for choice," says Miss <span class="sc">Casanova</span>, meditatively,
but seeing the Countess's horrified expression of countenance, she
takes care to add more languidly than ever, as if taking the smallest
part in an argument were really too exhausting, "but then, you
know, I really don't understand tragedy, and I love a laugh."</p>

<p>"Prefers <span class="sc">Arthur Roberts</span> to <span class="sc">Salvini</span>!" exclaims the Countess,
and throws up her hands and eyes to the ceiling as if imploring
Heaven not to visit on her the awful heresy of her child.</p>

<p>Here I interpose. <span class="sc">Salvini</span>, I say, is a great <i>Artiste</i>, no doubt
of
it, a marvellous Tragedian; and <span class="sc">Arthur Roberts</span> is not, in the true
dramatic sense of the word, a genuine Comedian; but he is, in
another sense a true Comedian, though of the Music-Hall school.</p>

<p>"What a school!" murmurs the Countess, and with a pained
expression of countenance as though she were suffering agonies.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Metterbruns</span> see the difference. Madame remembers a fat
comic man in Berlin, at some garden, who used to wear a big hat
and carry a large pipe, and make her laugh very much when she
was a girl. Certainly, in his way, he was an artist. Is this <span class="sc">Arthur
Roberts</span> anything like <span class="sc">Max Spl&uuml;tterwessel</span>? At this point, as we
have finished coffee, and the Countess finds the room hot, I propose
adjourning the debate to the Restaurant in the garden, as we are
too late for the band at the Casino Samie.</p>

<p>The party is broken up in order to walk down to our rendezvous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Puller</span>, whose idea of making things pleasant, and, as he expresses
it, "sweetening everyone all round," is to order "drinks" for everybody,
insists upon the party taking "<i>consommations</i>"&mdash;he loves
saying this word&mdash;at his expense. The Countess at first objects, as
also does Madame <span class="sc">Metterbrun</span>; but, on <span class="sc">Puller's</span> explaining that
he belongs to "The Two-with-you Society," they accept this explanation
as utterly unintelligible but perfectly satisfactory; and so,
accepting <span class="sc">Puller's</span> <i>al fresco</i> hospitality, we form a cheerful
group
round two tables put together for our accommodation. <span class="sc">Puller's</span>
hospitality has taken the form of grenadines, chartreuses, and
"sherry-gobblers,"&mdash;he loves this word too,&mdash;for us all round, and
he has ordered for himself a strange mixture, which perfumes
the night air as if some nauseous draught had been brought out
of a chemist's shop, and which looks like green stagnant water in
a big glass. It is called by <span class="sc">Puller</span>, with great glee, an "Absinthe
gummy."</p>

<p>Anything nastier to look at or to smell I am not acquainted with
in the way of drinks. However, he is our host, and I have a
grenadine before me of his ordering, and between my lips an excellent
cigar which is his gift. I can only say mildly, "It looks nasty;"
and Cousin <span class="sc">Jane</span> expresses herself to the same effect, remarking
also as she looks significantly towards me, that it is late, and that I
am not keeping Royat hours. I promise to come away in ten
minutes. <span class="sc">Puller</span> is in the highest possible spirits: surrounded by
this company, all drinking his drinks, he as it were takes the chair
and presides. He knocks on the table, which brings the waiter, to
whom he says, holding up a couple of fingers "Two with you,"&mdash;whereat
the waiter only smiles upon the eccentric Englishman, shakes
his head, and wisely retires.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miladi," says <span class="sc">Puller</span>, "you must take a course of <span class="sc">Roberts</span>.
He's a rum 'un." Then he sings, "He's all right when you know
him, but you've got to hear him <i>fust</i>."</p>

<p>His guests politely smile, all except the Countess. I preserve a
discreet silence. Taking this on the whole for encouragement,
<span class="sc">Puller</span> commences the song from which he has already quoted the
chorus. What the words are I do not catch, but as <span class="sc">Puller</span> reproduces
to the life the style and manner of a London Music-Hall
singer, and cocks his hat on one side, it is no wonder that the French
people at the other table turn towards us in amazement.</p>

<p>"For goodness sake, <span class="sc">Mr. Puller</span>!" cries the Countess, rising
from her chair in consternation. <span class="sc">Jane</span> also rises, Miss
<span class="sc">Casanova</span> is
laughing nervously. The <span class="sc">Metterbruns</span> look utterly astonished. I
feel I must stop this at once.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," I say, magisterially, "you really mustn't do
this sort of thing"&mdash;he is breaking out again with "<i>O what a
surprise!</i>"&mdash;but I get up from my seat to reprove him gravely.
"You would not do this if you were in a London Restaurant."</p>

<p>"No," he replies, not in the least offended&mdash;"that's the lark of
it. I belong to 'The Out-for-a-lark-and-Two-with-you Society.'
Don't you mind me," he adds; then turning with a pleasant wink
to the ladies, who have been putting on their wraps and mantles,
and are preparing to leave, he sings again,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"I'm all right when you know me&mdash;</p>
<p>But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>We leave him to finish the song by himself.</p>

<p>And to think that my friend <span class="sc">Puller</span>, with his hat cocked on one
side, a big cigar in his mouth, a tumbler of "absinthe gummy"
before him, a rakish expression in his eye, is the same <span class="sc">Puller</span> to
whom, as partner in the firm of <span class="sc">Horler, Puller, Puller (J),
Baker and Dayville</span>, Solicitors, I would trust my dearest interests
in any matter of property, of character, even of life itself! The
strange story of <i>Hyde</i> and <i>Jekyll</i> is no fiction, after all.</p>

<h3>"HOMES IN THE HILLS."</h3>

<blockquote><p>
[The absence of skilled nursing in the British
Military Hospitals in India having long been felt
to be a serious evil, leading to the needless sacrifice
of brave and valuable lives, the <span class="sc">Secretary</span> of
<span class="sc">State</span> has sanctioned the employment of Lady
Nurses in these hospitals. The Government of India
have undertaken the whole cost in connection with
this scheme, except the provision of "Homes in
the Hills," as restorative resorts for the Nursing
Sisters, when their own health feels the strain of
their arduous duties in such a climate as that of
the plains of India. The money required for this
most essential purpose the Government consider
might be "appropriately left to the active benevolence
of private individuals interested in the welfare
of the British Soldier in India."</p>

<p>For aid towards the establishment of these
"Homes in the Hills," Lady <span class="sc">Roberts</span>, wife of the
gallant Indian hero, Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Roberts</span>,
makes an appeal which <i>Mr. Punch</i> desires most
earnestly to second.</p>

<h3>HOLIDAY HINTS.</h3>

<h4>(<i>From Crowded-out Correspondents.</i>)</h4>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;The plan of your Correspondent, "<span class="sc">A Doubtful Sailor</span>," who
alleges that he avoids sea-sickness by drinking two bottles of
Champagne before starting, and then goes on board accompanied by
his Family Doctor, who administers alternately nitrous oxide gas and
ginger beer to him every ten minutes till the passage is over, though
no doubt an efficacious preventive, strikes me as less simple than the
means I invariably employ to secure a comfortable crossing. They
are easily available, and are as follows. Before I start I provide
myself with a six-foot mattrass, several yards of rope, and four screw-hooks,
which, the moment I enter the cabin, I proceed with a large
gimlet to fasten to the ceiling, and, before the Steward or passengers
have had time to protest, I have rigged myself up a capital swinging
bed in the very centre of the vessel. To jump in, occupy it, and keep
officials at bay with an umbrella, only needs a little nerve and
practice, and when once fairly out of port, specially if <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'if'">it</ins> be rough,
one is not very easily dislodged. In the course of thirteen passages,
I have only been overturned eleven times, in nine of which I was cut
down by order of the Captain; and though on several occasions,
through clinging to the swinging-lamp, I brought it down in the
struggle, and had to pay for the damage, I can confidently recommend
any one who has a horror of the Channel crossing, and does
not mind a brisk physical encounter with three Stewards, the First
Mate, and half the crew of one of the Folkestone and Boulogne boats,
to follow my example.
</p>


<p class="right">I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Abaft the Funnel.</span></p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;"<span class="sc">One who Hasn't Yet Done It</span>," wants to know how,
travelling with only one ticket, he can secure an entire third-class
compartment for the whole journey to himself. I will tell him. Let
him install himself in his quarters taking with him five full life-sized
lay-figures dressed in old great-coats with hats pulled down over
their ears and eyes, and let him arrange these picturesquely about
the carriage in attitudes indicative of the suffering of much internal
torture. Then let him stand at the window with a genial and good-humoured
expression on his face, and pointing over his shoulder to the
scene behind him, explain briefly to any passengers who are thinking
of entering, that he is travelling with "five aged uncles in the last
stage of delirium from a contagious and infectious fever," and he
will find they will instantly desist from their efforts and hurry to
another portion of the train. To carry out this little <i>ruse</i> successfully
it may be sometimes necessary to wink at the ticket-collector and
give him threepence, but this does not follow as a matter of course.
The plan will be found to work excellently on comparatively short
excursions to the sea-side, during which people sent in search of health
are necessarily anxious to avoid anything approaching to the risk of
contagion. For longer distances, such as a journey to the North for
instance, there is nothing like travelling with an Indian Chief, and
if possible, with a hy&aelig;na. The appearance of the former in gleaming
paint and feathers brandishing a tomahawk and uttering wild war-whoops
at every station, will be sure to prevent the intrusion of
women with babies, while even a country farmer, on seeing the
hy&aelig;na emerge from under the seat, and on your remarking smilingly,
"He isn't muzzled, but I don't think he'll bite," will be likely to
select some other compartment. I have travelled from King's Cross
to Inverness several times under the above conditions, and except on
one occasion at Perth, where the hy&aelig;na got loose and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: [sic]">eat</ins> thirteen
half-crown breakfasts, for which I had to pay, and on one other at
Edinburgh, when the Indian Chief scalped a ticket-collector by mistake,
I have never met with any sort of <i>contretemps</i>, but enjoyed
the journey in comfort, and kept the carriage the whole way entirely
to myself. At this season of the year when so many who are off "for
the grouse," think twice before putting their hands into their
pockets for the exorbitant fare of a journey first-class, my method of
securing all its comfort at half the cost, may possibly find some
votaries willing to profit by my experience. Such as it is, it is thus
freely placed at their disposal.
</p>


<p class="right">By yours inventively,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">There and Back.</span></p>


<p>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your Correspondent, a "<span class="sc">Stifled Invalid</span>," wants to know
how, in these days of ill-drained and ill-ventilated lodgings, he can
secure a breath of fresh sea-air without the risk of being prostrated
by a local fever, or poisoned by sewer gas. His course is simple
enough. He has only to do as I have done. Let him get a furniture-van
(if he is a married man with a family, he will want more&mdash;I
have five), and hire a traction-engine to drag him to some well-known
watering-place, and deposit him on the Pier. I have tried
the experiment, as yet, with every prospect of success. Here am I,
with my five vans, well installed at the end of the Pier of a well-known
fashionable health resort, the band playing twice a day, with the
fresh air blowing all about me, and the sea surrounding me on every
side. We managed to get on when the man who takes the tickets
was away having his dinner. The situation is quite delightful, and
but for the fact that all the local Authorities have commenced proceedings
against me, and that there was a slight riot last night
during an ineffectual attempt made by six-and-thirty cart-horses to
move me on to the Marine Parade, I have every reason to be satisfied
with the result of my experiment. I am living rent free, and, beyond
the cost of a family ticket for the Pier, which, though it is disputed
by the Committee, I insist gives me a right to have my vans on as
well, have, as yet, been put to no expense whatever. There was a
report that the Local Fire Brigade had resolved, in the event of my not
moving off, to force me to do so by "pumping" me out, but I am loth
to believe this. Meantime we are having some excellent fishing with
a lawn-tennis net. The traction-engine is to call for me in a month.
Strongly recommending my "Plan of Campaign" to a "<span class="sc">Stifled
Invalid</span>," I beg to subscribe myself, your obedient servant,

<h3>THE NOVEL-READER'S VADE MECUM.</h3>

<p><i>Question.</i> I believe you are a very rapid reader of fiction?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Certainly. My average rate is three and a half volumes
a day. This gives me plenty of time for meals, sleep and skipping.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:300px;"><a href="images/105.png"><img src="images/105-300.png" width="300" height="248" alt="Through Booking, First-Class and otherwise." /></a>
<p>Through Booking, First-Class and otherwise.</p></div>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you skip a great deal?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A very great deal. For instance,
I have skipped about two-thirds of <i>Isa</i>,
by the Editor of the <i>North-Eastern
Daily Gazette</i>, in spite of it being only
in a couple of volumes, and containing
for an introduction the following rather
lengthy sentence:&mdash;"If the devil were
in a laughing mood, what could seem
more grimly humorous to him than the
vision of a fair young spirit striving
consciously after ethereal perfection,
but overweighted unconsciously by the bonds and fetters of human
infirmity and passion, and dragged at last headlong down the
abysmal descent to perdition?" "Abysmal" is good&mdash;very good.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Well, and what of the book itself?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Chiefly horrors. Nightmare after a pork-chop supper I fancy.
<i>Nelly Jocelyn</i> (<i>Widow</i>), is a welcome contrast. One of the best
things
Miss <span class="sc">Jean Middlemass</span> has done. The character of <i>Paul Cazalet</i>
capitally drawn and foreign local colouring admirable.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What do you think of <i>His Own Enemy</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Fancy the title somehow must refer to the Author. Clerical
sketches full of unconscious humour. Two volumes but <i>very</i> big
ones. Quite a relief to get to <i>A False Start</i>,&mdash;by <span class="sc">Hawley Smart</span>,
which is most entertaining. But in this case the name of the Author
is a safe guarantee for something worth reading.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What do you think of <i>A Modern Circe</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I fancy it is not quite so good as <i>Molly Brown</i>, by the same
Author.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What do you know of <i>Molly Brown</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Nothing&mdash;I have not read it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What have you to say about <i>Scamp</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That it is by the Author of <i>The Silent Shadow</i>, which I fancy
must be the sequel of another novel called <i>The Garrulous Ghost</i>.
In the first chapter the heroine <i>Scamp</i>, (a young lady) is discovered
up a tree from which coign of vantage she throws a yellow-paper-covered
novel at the gardener's head.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> The first chapter then must be vastly entertaining?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Vastly. I am absolutely dying to read the chapters that follow
it, and will&mdash;some day.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is <i>Brother or Lover</i> about? <i>A.</i> I don't know&mdash;do you?</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> This is trifling! Pray describe <i>Out of Tune</i>.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Ought to have been called <i>Out of Paganini</i>&mdash;founded upon
that distinguished fiddler's life, although (as the Author says) "it is
necessarily speculative as to its details."</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Have you read <i>In the King's Service</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Some of it. Fancy it deals with the Peninsular War.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How about <i>Jill and Jack</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Book I imagine written before the title. Rather hard work to
get up the hill which ends with the last chapter.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is <i>Hidden in my Heart</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Seemingly the words which finish the third volume, "It is two
years now since <i>Hubert</i> died, and to-morrow is my second wedding-day."</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is this the first novel that the Authoress has written?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh dear no. She has also published <i>Out of Eden</i>, <i>Quite
True</i>,
and a book which apparently refers to the late-in-life "finishing"
of an uneducated ecclesiastic called <i>The Vicar's Governess</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Don't you think that you are rather hard upon the novelists?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I hope not. I am sure I owe them a deep, deep debt of
gratitude.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How so? <i>A.</i> Without them I should be a victim to insomnia.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<h5>EXTRACTED FROM</h5>

<h4>THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday August 22.</i>&mdash;Peers at last face the
inevitable. As records have shown there has been for week or two
no work for them to do. Still, they have eased their tender consciences
by assembling to see <span class="sc">Halsbury</span> take the Woolsack. (Always
a pleasing spectacle. Innate grace of <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span> comes out in
every step and gesture.) To-night there was, as usual, nothing to
do; but Noble Lords really could not again make believe that Nation
could not get on without them. So stayed away, and for one night
House of Lords abolished.</p>

<p>In Commons at hour for commencing public business barely a
quorum present. Both Front Bench and Treasury Bench vacant.
<span class="sc">George Balfour</span>, always ready to throw himself into breach, took
possession of seat of Leader of Opposition, and calmly gazed across
table. Never should it be said as long as he had seat in House that
Liberals were as sheep without a shepherd. Few Members on back
benches visibly brightened up at sight of veteran volunteer.</p>

<p>Only a few questions, but unwonted difficulty in getting through
them. Some cases the questioner not present. In others Minister
addressed not yet arrived. <span class="sc">McArthur</span> had question down pretty
early in list. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> called upon him. No response. Went on to
next question. Quarter of an hour later, all other questions run
through. <span class="sc">McArthur</span> coming in put his question to Parliamentary
Secretary for Foreign Affairs. <span class="sc">Fergusson</span>, who had also just
arrived, supposing that <span class="sc">McArthur</span> had put question in due course,
apologised to him for not having been in his place; whereat House
laughed uproariously. Very grateful in these times for anything
that looks like joke.</p>

<p><span class="sc">P. Stanhope</span> brought under notice of Home Secretary case of
enterprising parish constable in North Hunts. P.C., a supporter of
Her Majesty's Government, resented Liberal candidate presenting
himself before constituency. Determined he should not be heard.
Brought down enormous rattle; swung it about throughout candidate's
speech. <span class="sc">Joseph Gillis</span> pricked up his ears. What a notion
this would be for adaptation to Parliamentary usage! Suppose he
had rattle and swung it whilst <span class="sc">Saunderson</span> or <span class="sc">Johnston</span> were
speaking? Will consult <span class="sc">Speaker</span> as to how far this would be in
order. <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> declined to be responsible for either parish
constable or his rattle.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Votes on Supply.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Lords sat ten minutes to-night. Home to dinner, with
sense of deserving well of country.</p>

<p>Commons at work again in Supply. Considered Vote for Science
and Art Department, South Kensington. <span class="sc">Cavendish-Bentinck</span>
contributed one or two speeches of great interest. Thin attendance,
and prevalent air of lassitude. But, whilst on legs, C.-B. riveted
attention. Very indignant with neglect of Art in common life. Old
Members accustomed to Right Hon. Gentleman's little trick, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
which he is sole repository. But new Members tremble, and grow
pale, as, when denouncing any person or practice, Right Hon.
Gentleman mysteriously raises his hair till it stands on end. Once
this phenomenon came about when he denounced certain weighing-machines,
which, he said, had recently been put up at London
railway stations. Tops of this machine, he said, were supported by
two columns, one supposed to be Ionic, and the other Doric.</p>

<p>"As matter of fact," said <span class="sc">C.-B.</span>, his hair slowly uprising, "they're
neither one thing nor the other, but simply German!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, fixed fiery eye on <span class="sc">Home Secretary. Matthews</span>, so
accustomed to be badgered, and feeling his perfect innocence in this
respect, shook his head. Phenomenon witnessed again when
<span class="sc">Bentinck</span> discovered that picture, bought at <span class="sc">Christie's</span> for 120
guineas, subsequently sold to National Gallery for 400. Hair rose in
angry protest.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Thirteen Votes passed.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Dreary wilderness of House of Commons blossomed
to-night like a rose-garden. Yesterday, and for days before, empty
benches and a fagged remnant wrestling with routine votes. To-night
House crowded, and buzz of excitement filled chamber. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
going to move hostile Resolution on Government proposal to
proclaim Land League. Every Member in town early in his place.
Members from afar arrived post haste. Even <span class="sc">Randolph</span>, temporarily
returns. Old Morality smiles ghastly smile of welcome, but knees
tremble as he wonders what <span class="sc">Randolph</span> means to do. The <span class="sc">O'Gorman
Mahon</span> back again, <span class="sc">Parnell</span> having elected him for Carlow
County. The old boy as young as ever, and full of reminiscences
of his early Parliamentary career, which goes back immeasurable
distance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:250px;"><a href="images/108a.png"><img src="images/108a-210.png" width="210" height="470" alt="C. Br-dl-gh." /></a>
<p class="center">C. Br-dl-gh.</p></div>

<p>"Ah," he said, looking at the Mace, "there it is agin. I remimber
well the afternoon&mdash;we always sat in the afternoon thin&mdash;when
<span class="sc">Cromwell</span> came down, and said, 'Take away that bauble, ye
spalpeens, or I'll make it worse for ye.' I was younger then, <span class="sc">Toby</span>
me bhoy, indade quite a young man."</p>

<p>Old boy's limp is, I fancy, getting better. He has suffered it for
some years now. Seems that one day towards the close of last
century <span class="sc">Burke</span> flung dagger on floor of
House by way of peroration. Weapon rebounded,
and struck The <span class="sc">Mahon</span> on the
instep. If you step into the lavatory with
him, he'll show you the scar.</p>

<p>"A mere thrifle, a mere thrifle, acushla!
They were lively bhoys when I was in me
proime."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Gladstone</span> in fine form and excellent
voice. Honoured occasion by donning one
of his biggest collars and a new necktie.
Curious proof of his persuasiveness how he
gradually talked his necktie round till
knot rested under left ear. <span class="sc">Balfour</span>
squealed forth his disapprobation for upwards
of an hour. Rather a pitiful spectacle,
the more so by reason of the contrast.</p>

<p>"He should try to avoid immediately
following <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>," said <span class="sc">Randolph</span>,
looking down contemptuously at his former
friend.</p>

<p>Best speeches after first, <i>longo intervallo</i>,
were <span class="sc">Bradlaugh's</span> and <span class="sc">Robertson's</span>, the
Scotch Solicitor-General. Conservatives
quite forgotten their old animosity to
Member for Northampton. As for Parnellites,
cheer him madly as they do
<span class="sc">Parnell</span>. Certainly <span class="sc">Bradlaugh</span> has acquired
House of Commons' manner. Speeches in good style and full
of point.</p>

<p>Quite a treat to hear such speech as <span class="sc">Robertson's</span> from Treasury
Bench. Mem. for Markiss. Why not double his salary, and let him
speak from <span class="sc">Matthews's</span> brief, and, above all, from <span class="sc">Balfour's</span>?</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Proclamation of National League.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Amphibious old Warrior, who has been Admiral afloat,
Generalissimo ashore, and is now Member for County Carlow, reappeared
to-night, and took oath. It was a moving scene. Old
veteran got up in rather young-looking costume, light tweed, with
white waistcoat, in cut what young beau of twenty might wear.</p>

<p>"Why, Colonel," said <span class="sc">Cyril Flower</span>, a judge of these things,
"you look younger than ever in your new suit!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:300px;"><a href="images/108b.png"><img src="images/108b-280.png" width="280" height="346" alt="Lord H-rt-ngt-n's attitude towards" /></a>
<p class="center">Lord H-rt-ngt-n's attitude towards
Mr. Gl-dst-ne.</p>
</div>

<p>"New, bedad," says The <span class="sc">Mahon</span>, "why I had 'em made to go to
the wedding of <span class="sc">William</span> and <span class="sc">Mary</span>. All Mimbers of Parliament
invoited; special seats in Abbey; and, what's more, a good luncheon
at <span class="sc">Bellamy's</span>. Haven't worn suit lately; thought it would do for
this festive occasion."</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Mahon's</span> advance to table to take oath a triumphal progress.
Members on both sides cheered like mad. The Colonel stopped half
way, and, facing friends and countrymen, blew them a kiss from
tips of fingers. Turning to Ministerialists, who joined in applause
he bowed gracefully. Clerks had
greatest difficulty in convoying him
to <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Chair. Broke away
from escort, and shook hands with
Old Morality. No joke when The
<span class="sc">Mahon</span> shakes hands. Pumps away
violently for several moments, as if
ship were leaking, and all depended
on him. Next got hold of <span class="sc">Balfour</span>,
and avenged long woes of Ireland.
At last got at <span class="sc">Speaker</span>.
Thought he'd never let go.
Pumped away till the
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> had hardly breath
to call "Order! order!"
Finally flopped himself
down next to <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>,
on Front Bench, and gave
him fearful shaking up.</p>

<p>This, liveliest episode in
debate. Some pretty good
speaking, but everyone sick
to death of topic.</p>

<p>A little movement of interest
when <span class="sc">Hartington</span> rose;
but happiest moment when
bell rang, and Division actually at hand. Business done.&mdash;Proclamation
of Land League approved.</p>

<h3>A SUMMER SOLILOQUY.</h3>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A bee, or not a bee? That is the question.</p>
<p>Whether 'twere better not to mind, and suffer</p>
<p>The stings that every summer are our portion,</p>
<p>Or take the trouble but to move an arm,</p>
<p>And, by opposing, end them. It flies&mdash;it creeps,</p>
<p>It creeps, perchance it stings! Then comes the rub,</p>
<p>When we have shuffled off our clothing. Soft,</p>
<p>'Twas but a bluebottle! How sweet it is</p>
<p>To lie like this i' the sun, and think of nought</p>
<p>Save how sweet 'tis to lie, and think of nought;</p>
<p>And that meseems to many wordy sages</p>
<p>Were small refreshment in this windy time.</p>
<p>How many are there who do cheat themselves,</p>
<p>And with themselves the many, that they are</p>
<p>The very vaward leaders of the fray,</p>
<p>The lictors of the pomp of intellect.</p>
<p>Whereas they are the merest driven spray,</p>
<p>The running rabble heralding the march</p>

<h3>IRISH NET PROFIT.</h3>

<p>In connection with the establishment, thanks chiefly to the
munificence of Lady <span class="sc">Burdett-Coutts</span> and the Duke of <span class="sc">Norfolk</span>,
at Baltimore (Cork) of
a New Industrial
Fishery School to the
end of teaching the
fishermen there how
to make the most of
their hauls, the
<i>Times</i>, as one example
of the need of
that instruction for
those toilers of the
Sea, very justly observes
that "their
ignorance of the art
of curing fish causes
them endless loss."
The hap of Kill or
Cure may be hazarded
by physicians, but the practice of fishermen should be to kill and
cure too&mdash;kill first and cure afterwards. Sure, no Irishman can
fail to see the force of that. An Irish peasant sometimes when his pig
is poorly, kills the animal, as he says, to save its life, whereby, of
course, he means, to save his bacon. Fishermen should be up to
curing all fish that are curable&mdash;except&mdash;they are not bootmakers&mdash;the
cure of soles!</p>
